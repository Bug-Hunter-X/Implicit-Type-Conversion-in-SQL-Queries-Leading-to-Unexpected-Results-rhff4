This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving implicit type conversion.  The `bug.sql` file contains a query that implicitly converts a numeric column to a string, leading to potentially incorrect results. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides a corrected version of the query that explicitly handles type conversions and avoids ambiguity.  This is important for data integrity and query optimization.
