The SQL query uses a function that implicitly converts a numeric column to a string before comparing it to a string literal. This can lead to unexpected results due to implicit type conversions and potentially inefficient query plans.  For example, comparing a numeric column to a string: `SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE numeric_column = '10';`
